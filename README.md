# pipelined_processor_structural

Central processing unit is one of the most important creations in the humanâ€™s history. 
It carries out the instructions and the data from memory. It is the key element of 
computers. In the previous project, we have completed a single cycle processor, however, 
the efficiency is a big problem. In this experiment, we design a pipelined processor and 
achieve it using the VHDL.
